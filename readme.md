# Spielwiese Py

An incoherent collection of python scripts.

Nothing worth a project by itself. Just some things to play around with, hence the name Spielwiese (german for (creative) playground).

## Chess - The Card Game.

Welcome to another random challenge inspired by @ChessSimp.
You play chess but have limited options like in a card game.
If you want to move a piece or pawn, you must play the card first.

This is the script that uses the command line to simulate which cards
you hold in your hand, updated by which are played and drawn.
